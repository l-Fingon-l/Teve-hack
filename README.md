# WORK IN PROGRESS
Let's hack the [Twilight Eve's](https://tever.xyz/) save-load system!  

Primarily a learning-focused project that leverages a handful of tools including:
- [Brython](https://brython.info/) (client-side python web scripting)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) (html-oriented CSS framework)
- [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) editor for low-level data manipulation  
*and others*
